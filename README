This project is for making it easy to use SLIME in Quicklisp.

To use it, do this:

  (ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")
  (quicklisp-slime-helper:install)

It will a file in the Quicklisp base directory called
"slime-helper.el". That file will search the quicklisp-slime-helper
dist for an installed slime.el file, and add its directory to the
Emacs load-path.

In your ~/.emacs, you could have something like this:

  (load (expand-file-name "~/quicklisp/slime-helper.el"))
  (require 'slime)
  (slime-setup '(slime-fancy))
  (setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl")
